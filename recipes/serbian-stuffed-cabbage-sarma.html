                        This recipe for Serbian stuffed cabbage, or sarma, is a
                        hearty dish that many Serbs serve every day but
                        especially for special occasions like slavas and other
                        holidays. Recipes vary from cook to cook, but they all
                        consist of a meat filling wrapped in cabbage and cooked
                        over sauerkraut. This recipe includes a tomato sauce for
                        more flavor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Stuffed cabbage in one form or another is present in
                        most world cuisines but especially among Eastern
                        Europeans. Czechs and Slovaks call them ​holubky and
                        Poles refer to them as ​gołąbki. They all boil down to
                        the same thing—meat and a filler like rice or barley
                        rolled up in a cabbage leaf and cooked on the stove or
                        in the oven.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some people use imported or homemade whole heads of
                        brined cabbage (sauerkraut) known as kiseli kupus when
                        making their sarma. This recipe uses steamed cabbage
                        leaves to wrap the filling and cooks atop a bed of
                        shredded cabbage and sauerkraut.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sarma, or Serbian stuffed cabbage, is a meal in and of
                        itself and needs little accompaniment. A side of fresh
                        bread or potato salad makes it a feast, or try starting
                        with soup like pasulj.

                    <h5>
                        "The Serbian stuffed cabbage was a nice change of pace
                        with the tomato sauce mixture and the sour flavor from
                        the sauerkraut. The onion soup-seasoned filling was
                        delicious, too. If your brand of dry onion soup envelope
                        weighs only 1 ounce, add 1 1/2 envelopes." —Diana
